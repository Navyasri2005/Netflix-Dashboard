# Netflix Dashboard in Tableau

## Overview
This project involves creating a comprehensive dashboard in Tableau to analyze Netflix data. The dashboard provides insights into user behavior, content trends, and other key performance indicators (KPIs). It is designed to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions by visualizing critical metrics in an interactive and user-friendly manner.

## Features
- **Content Analysis**: Breakdown of content by genre, release year, and duration.
- **User Engagement**: Insights into viewing patterns, including popular content and peak viewing times.
- **Regional Trends**: Analysis of regional preferences and performance.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Filters, tooltips, and dynamic charts for in-depth exploration.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes information about Netflix titles, such as:
- Title
- Genre
- Release Year
- Duration
- Country
- Ratings
- User interactions (views, likes, etc., if available)

The dataset was sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/swatikhedekar/exploratory-data-analysis-on-netflix-data 

## Objectives
1. Identify trends in Netflix content production.
2. Understand user preferences and viewing patterns.
3. Provide actionable insights for content strategy and regional marketing.

## Tools Used
- **Tableau**: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tools like Python (Pandas, NumPy) or Excel for cleaning and preparing the dataset.

## Dashboard Highlights
1. **Genre Distribution**: A pie chart showing the proportion of different genres available on Netflix.
2. **Release Trends**: A line chart displaying the number of titles released over the years.
3. **Top Titles**: A bar chart highlighting the most popular titles based on user engagement.
4. **Regional Insights**: A map visualization showing content preferences by country.

## How to Use the Dashboard
